# hello-world

I'm a brand new coder, new to Git Hub.  I'm learning SQL, Command line, and hopefully Python soon.
I'm unfamiliar with the command line, and not great at installing software.  I also really need to get better at working with Excel and other spreadsheet software.  Basically, total nube.
